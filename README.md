## Introduction

_“Show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future.”_

Our personal relationships define us. They determine the opportunities that come our way, the success we experience in our various endeavours, and the satisfaction we get out of life.

If you’re looking for the best investment your time, it’s simply this: develop stronger connections to people that help you get more out of your life.

A well-designed PRM (personal relationship management) application can serve as an invaluable instrument to developing those stronger connections. Such a tool, used with care and consistency, allows you to lend continuity to your interactions and focus your time and energy on the people that matter. Ultimately this allows you to get – and give! – the most value in your personal relationships.

Existing PRM solutions, however, are essentially rolodexes brimming with sticky notes. You add people, fill in their details, add notes and reminders,… When all of that’s been done, it’s up to you to stay au courant and periodically review those notes. These PRM applications require plenty of attention paid to them to function properly and – at the end of the day – often get in the user’s way.

“Jocelyn” takes a different approach. Imagine carrying a journal in your pocket, that you can use throughout the day to jot down the gist of your interactions with others. While you’re busy hustlin’ and living life Jocelyn — unlike a notebook — will be busy organizing and preparing insights for you.

Romans politicians had their nomenclatores. Modern politicians have their Farley files.

You will have Jocelyn.



## Dictionary

**Jotting**: a quick note written about 'relations', i.e. the people you care about. These notes can contain any kind of information: an upcoming event, gift ideas, thoughts about their personalities, an interaction they've had with someone else etc.

**Relation**: a person you care about. Jocelyn allows you to add all the people you care about and add a short description for your convience.

**Moniker**: every Relation has a "moniker"... a unique nickname consisting of letters or numbers (no spaces or special characters). Using this, Relations can be 'mentioned' in Jottings.

**Mention**: using the '@'-character followed by a Relation's moniker in a Jotting, 'mentions' that Relation. This Jotting will then appear in that Relation's list of Jottings when you view their profile.


## How to Use Jocelyn


### 1. The Home Screen

The home screen will show you your latest jottings, so you always have a quick overview to glance at. From the home screen, you can launch 2 activities:

 1. Add Jotting, using the action button at the bottom right.
 2. Consult the relation overview.


### 2. Add Jotting

Jottings are simple written notes, that you can start typing right away. Using the '@'-character will prompt a drop-down list of Relations whose name or moniker match what you're typing. These Relations are ordered by number of mentions they have in other Jottings, so when typing the '@'-character you'll first get a list of your most popular Relations.

Clicking on the 'eye'-icon of any Relation in the Relation suggestion drop-down list will take you to their personal page (see 4. Relation Detail).


### 3. Relation Overview

The relation overview shows all of your Relations as cards, ordered by number of mentions. By clicking on the overflow icon (3 dots), you can take 2 actions with regards to a Relation:

 1. View their information and jottings (ordered by date, most recent first).
 2. Update their information (name, current moniker, or description).

You can also use the action button at the bottom right to create a new Relation.


### 4. Relation Detail

The Relatoin Detail activity shows a particular Relation's full name, current moniker, and description in the app bar. Below you'll find a list of Jottings where they are a Mention, sorted chronologically with the most recent Jottings appearing at the top.


### 5. Create/Edit Relation

In the Relation Overview, it's possible to either create or edit a relation. To create a Relation, tap the floating action bottom in the bottom right. To update an existing Relation, click the overflow menu and choose 'Edit Relation Info'.

A Relation has:

 1. A Full Name of at most 40 characters.
 2. A unique Moniker consisting of only letters or numbers and at most 20 characters
 3. An optional description.

Warnings will let you know if you're not sticking to those rules.
