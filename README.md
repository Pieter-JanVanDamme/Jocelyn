_“Show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future.”_

Our personal relationships define us. They determine the opportunities that come our way, the success we experience in our various endeavours, and the satisfaction we get out of life.

If you’re looking for the best investment your time, it’s simply this: develop stronger connections to people that help you get more out of your life.

A well-designed PRM (personal relationship management) application can serve as an invaluable instrument to developing those stronger connections. Such a tool, used with care and consistency, allows you to lend continuity to your interactions and focus your time and energy on the people that matter. Ultimately this allows you to get – and give! – the most value in your personal relationships.

Existing PRM solutions, however, are essentially rolodexes brimming with sticky notes. You add people, fill in their details, add notes and reminders,… When all of that’s been done, it’s up to you to stay au courant and periodically review those notes. These PRM applications require plenty of attention paid to them to function properly and – at the end of the day – often get in the user’s way.

“Jocelyn” takes a different approach. Imagine carrying a journal in your pocket, that you can use throughout the day to jot down the gist of your interactions with others. While you’re busy hustlin’ and living life Jocelyn — unlike a notebook — will be busy organizing and preparing insights for you.

Romans politicians had their nomenclatores. Modern politicians have their Farley files.

You will have Jocelyn.
